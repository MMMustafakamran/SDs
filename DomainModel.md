 2.5 DomainModel
 The domain model represents the core entities in ParhaiPartner and their relationships. It pro
vides a conceptual blueprint for the database schema and backend architecture implemented in

ferentiating between students, teachers, and counsellorsthe model conceptually distinguishes
 them to illustrate their distinct responsibilities.
